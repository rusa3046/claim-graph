"""The unattended daily loop: collect, extract, resolve, publish, report.

    python -m fragrance_graph.daily run
    python -m fragrance_graph.daily run --dry-run     # no key, no spend

    1. YouTube: search fragrance discussion, on seeds the catalogue
       chooses (`catalogue_seeds`) — the popular, note-carrying bottles
       the corpus cannot speak about yet
    2. ingest -> extract
    3. backfill: resolve every mention the curated dictionary already covers
    4. export -> pages -> report

## There used to be a fifth step, and it bought nothing

Between them, steps 3 and 4 once had a catalogue lookup: ask Fragella
about mentions people had newly started writing, and auto-curate the ones
where no judgement was required. It was a good idea and it did not work.

Measured 2026-08-12: **60 lookups, $3.00 charged, 5 names, 0 pages.** The
catalogue does not carry the small houses this corpus actually discusses,
so the mentions worth resolving were exactly the ones it could not answer.
Read against the ledger, it was $1.45 of the $2.78 this project has ever
spent -- more than half the money, for nothing that reached a reader.

It was removed on 2026-08-14. What replaced it is `resolve.entities
batch` / `apply`: an offline review file with two real comment spans and
the video titles behind each mention, which a person fills in with no
network and no spend. One sitting of that produced 4 bottles, 2 aliases,
49 resolved mentions and a page.

The reasoning the lookup path encoded is not lost -- SPEC records the
flanker rule and the negative result, and `docs/CURATION.md` records what
a curator is deciding. Only the code that could not pay for itself is
gone.

## Nothing here spends without the cap

Every paid step goes through `budget.Budget`, a hard $1/day stop backed by
a committed ledger. See `budget.py` for why the ledger is a file rather
than a table. With the catalogue gone, extraction is the only thing left
that costs money.

    """Searches aimed at catalogued bottles the corpus cannot speak about.

    `SEED_QUERIES` names ten bottles chosen when the catalogue held 56.
    The catalogue now holds 548, and the fixed list has no way to learn
    that: every run pours more evidence onto Aventus and Layton while 419
    bottles stay unrecommendable for want of a single claim. This asks the
    catalogue what is missing instead.

    Four conditions, each doing a specific job:

    - **A retailer listing with a review count.** The count is a proxy
      for "would YouTube bother", and it is the condition that makes this
      work at all. `SEED_QUERIES`' docstring already records the trap —
      *a broader question about a bottle nobody discusses returns nothing
      either way* — and seeding straight from the catalogue would walk
      into it, since most of a 548-bottle retail catalogue is obscure. A
      bottle with 15,227 Nordstrom reviews is not obscure. Retail
      popularity is the only signal here that predicts YouTube coverage
      without already having YouTube coverage.
    - **Declared notes.** A bottle whose notes we hold can be recommended
      the moment it has any perceptual evidence, so collecting for it
      converts directly. One with neither notes nor comments needs two
      things and is a worse buy for the same quota unit.
    - **No community claims.** The point. A bottle with evidence is not
      what this is for, however popular it is.
    - **Never searched before.** Rotation, and honest about its own
      limits: it matches the bottle's name against past
      `retrieval_query` rows, so a run that searched a bottle and found
      nothing does not search it again next Thursday. The corpus grows
      into the catalogue instead of circling.

    One bottle per brand, because three La Vie est Belle flankers would
    otherwise take three of ten slots and return overlapping videos —
    measured on this catalogue, the unpartitioned top ten held three of
    that family and two MYSLF variants.

    Deterministic: same database, same seeds. The tie-break on name
    exists so a run is reproducible rather than dependent on how Postgres
    felt about equal review counts.

    Returns query strings, not names — `_collect` searches text, and the
    shape a bottle is asked about matters as much as which bottle it is
