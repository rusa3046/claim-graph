# Operating rules — fragrance-graph

## Single writer

**Claude is the only agent that writes to this working tree.** Not "the
primary" writer, not "usually" — the only one. Every commit on every branch
in this repository is authored through this session.

That invariant is what makes the git history readable: when something breaks,
`git log` is a record of decisions someone can reconstruct, not a merge of
two agents' half-understandings. It is cheap to keep and expensive to
recover once lost.

Codex is a reviewer. It reads a frozen commit in a sibling directory and
reports. It does not write here, ever.

## Codex is advisory by default

A Codex finding is an argument, not an instruction. It runs against one
commit with no access to this conversation, the corpus decisions, or the
reasoning in the docstrings — which is exactly what makes it useful, and
exactly why it is confidently wrong a good fraction of the time.

Before acting on any finding: open the cited file, read the cited function,
check `tests/` for an existing guard. Classify it — confirmed / partially
correct / false positive / already handled — and report how many were
rejected. **A checkpoint where nothing was rejected means the files were not
opened.**

Nothing Codex reports changes this tree without a person deciding it should.

## Phase checkpoints go through the script, not the plugin

Use `scripts/codex-agent.sh`. The plugin runs `codex` against whatever
directory this session was launched in, which is this repository, which
breaks single-writer on the first invocation.

```
scripts/codex-agent.sh review   <phase> [focus]   # read-only, frozen commit
scripts/codex-agent.sh redteam  <phase>           # read-only, adversarial
scripts/codex-agent.sh delegate <phase> <file>    # write lane, in a clone
scripts/codex-agent.sh status
scripts/codex-agent.sh close    <phase> [--force]
```

Wrapped by `/codex-checkpoint` and `/codex-delegate`. The script enforces
what a prompt cannot: `-C` always points at a sibling directory and aborts if
it resolves to this repo, read lanes pass `--sandbox read-only`, the write
lane uses a clone rather than a worktree, and both lanes refuse to start on a
dirty tree.

## Two plugin commands to never run unasked

- **`/codex:rescue`** writes to *this* directory. It is the single fastest
  way to lose the invariant above.
- **`/codex:transfer`** ships this session's transcript to OpenAI. The
  transcript contains the corpus decisions, the spend ledger reasoning, and
  whatever the user has said in it.

Ask before either. Never as a step inside a larger plan the user approved in
general terms — approval for the plan is not approval for these.

The plugin's stop-time review gate stays **off**. It installs a `Stop` hook
that fires on every turn.

## Commit through the checkpoint script

Use `scripts/checkpoint.sh -m "..."`. It runs ruff, the full suite, the
provenance audit and the recommendation benchmark as separate checked
steps, and refuses to commit if any fails.

This exists because a commit landed with failing tests twice, both from
the same shape:

    uv run pytest -q 2>&1 | tail -3 && git commit ...

A pipeline's exit status is the last command's, so that reads as "if
`tail` succeeded, commit". Knowing this does not prevent it; the mistake
happens while assembling a long command for another purpose. The script
does the remembering.

`--quick` skips the audit and benchmark for work that cannot affect them.

## A rebuilt database needs five more commands

`corpus import` restores everything the corpus holds, and nothing else.
Two tables are computed from it rather than stored in it, and neither
survives:

```
uv run python -m fragrance_graph.attributes infer      # claim_attributions
uv run python -m fragrance_graph.semantic backfill     # evidence_embeddings
```

Both are free and take seconds. The import prints this itself when either
is empty **or stale**, and stale is the case worth knowing about: claims
have no natural key, so an import deletes and re-inserts them and every id
changes. `claim_attributions` cascades and goes visibly empty;
`evidence_embeddings` has no foreign key, so every row survives pointing at
a claim that no longer exists. Counting rows says that table is fine.

Skipping them costs 22/22 on the recommendation benchmark, which
`checkpoint.sh` gates commits on — so a fresh clone cannot commit, for a
reason unrelated to whatever it changed.

Three more tables are *curated input* under `data/curation/`, which
`corpus import` never reads:

```
uv run python -m fragrance_graph.houses import         # houses
uv run python -m fragrance_graph.retail import         # retailer_listings + declared notes
uv run python -m fragrance_graph.notes import          # brand-declared notes
```

**The retail import is the one that fails quietly.** Catalog-first
candidate generation reads `retailer_listings` and the declared-note map
directly, so a database without them still answers every query — from
community evidence alone, which is precisely the failure catalog-first
generation exists to prevent. Nothing errors. The answers just get small
again.

## Never merge Codex work

Harvest with `git fetch <clone-path> <branch>`, then read each diff and
cherry-pick, or reimplement. Never `git merge` — it takes the whole branch
and its history in one act that is awkward to unpick, and it puts commits in
this tree that nobody read.

A returned commit is a patch from a stranger with no context on this
codebase. Read the whole diff, confirm any new test fails against the old
code, run `uv run ruff check . && uv run pytest -q` yourself rather than
trusting a reported result, and reject anything touching `data/corpus/` —
that is the source of truth and it is not regenerable.

## Where things stand, and what the environment will do to you

Written 2026-08-27 so a session starting cold does not have to re-derive
any of it. The product decisions live in [docs/FACET.md](docs/FACET.md);
this is the operational half.

### The repository was renamed

`TestFragProj` → **`claim-graph`**, 2026-08-27. GitHub redirects the old
URL permanently, so old clones and links keep working. What does *not*
follow the rename is this environment's credential, which is scoped to
the **old** name on both surfaces: the GitHub MCP tools answer
`owner="rusa3046", repo="TestFragProj"` and return `403 GitHub access to
this repository is not enabled for this session` for `claim-graph`, and
`git push` to the new URL is refused with "not in this session's
authorized repository set" while the same push to
`https://github.com/rusa3046/TestFragProj` succeeds through the
redirect. So: keep `origin` on the old URL, open and merge PRs with the
old name, and expect a stop-hook "unpushed commits" warning after a push
by URL until `git fetch` refreshes the tracking ref. `add_repo` with
`access: "push"` for `claim-graph` needs the operator to approve it and
has not been.

### The Anthropic key must be scoped to a workspace

An organization-level key is not enough. It authenticates, then every
request fails with `400 invalid_request_error: This API key is not scoped
to a workspace, so this request must include the anthropic-workspace-id
header`. Nothing in this project sends that header and nothing should
start: create the key inside a workspace in the console instead.

The failure that precedes it looks different and is worth recognising —
`401 authentication_error: API key is invalid` — and it is what killed
extraction for three weeks (see the README's daily-loop section). Test a
key without touching the database or the corpus:

```
uv run python -c "
from fragrance_graph.extract.llm import build_client, MODEL
c = build_client()
print(c.messages.create(model=MODEL, max_tokens=4,
      messages=[{'role':'user','content':'say ok'}]).content[0].text)"
```

The key lives in two places and both matter: the `FRAGRANCE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
repository secret drives the scheduled loop, and the environment variable
of the same name drives anything run from a session here.

### `corpus export` here reorders every file

Run on this machine, the export rewrites all seven corpus files — a
14,000-line diff — while `sorted(old) == sorted(new)` for six of them.
The rows are identical; the text collation is not the CI runner's, and
the committed files carry CI's order. Committing that churn means the
next scheduled run flips it straight back. After an export, restore
every file you did not mean to change and keep only the rows you added:

```
git checkout -- data/corpus/{claims,comments,fragrances,rejected_claims,video_discoveries,videos}.jsonl
git diff --stat      # should be eval_labels.jsonl and spend.jsonl only
```

For `eval_labels.jsonl` build the committed file plus the new rows
appended, rather than taking the re-sorted export as written.

### What the five gates are for

`scripts/checkpoint.sh` runs ruff, the suite, the provenance audit, the
recommendation benchmark, and — added 2026-08-27 — the **card golden**.
The first four check rules. The fifth checks the artifact, and it exists
because six defects reached a person's screen in one week with all
1,815 tests passing: an inverted note match, a catalog sentence spliced
into a community frame, a chip counted twice, a declared note scored at a
quarter of a comment, a performance chip compiled as a note, and a
headcount line reading "0 people across 0 channels".

Every one of them lived in the *assembled card*, which no unit test
looked at. If you change anything a customer reads, expect
`data/eval/cards.golden.txt` to move; read the diff, decide whether it is
an improvement, then `uv run python -m fragrance_graph.evals.cards
--update` and commit the golden **with** the change that caused it.

A golden that renders its own copy of a card would drift from the product
and pass forever, so `evals/cards.py` goes through `api._session_response`
— the same function the kiosk's handlers return. Keep it that way.

### The asymmetry that explains most "bad recommendation" reports

Notes, families and occasions are answerable from the **catalogue**;
longevity, projection and vibes exist **only** in community evidence.
So a request weighted toward performance will always favour well-discussed
bottles, however good the catalog data is — 47 of 548 bottles carry
longevity evidence. That is a data-coverage fact, not a ranking bug, and
it is why `catalogue_seeds` now aims collection at popular, note-carrying
bottles the corpus cannot speak about. Check coverage before assuming the
ranker is wrong.

### The full gate takes ~12 minutes

Longer than the 10-minute shell timeout, so run it detached with a log
and poll the log — do not chain sleeps. Two more traps that have each
cost a session: `pkill` in the same command as anything else kills the
tool's own process group (exit 144), and two `pytest` runs at once
clobber the shared test database and produce failures that are not real.
One suite run at a time.

Real-corpus tests skip silently unless `FRAGRANCE_DB_URL` points at a
populated developer database. A "1801 passed, 14 skipped" is not the same
run as "1815 passed" — check which you got before trusting it.

### Open, in rough priority order

1. **Deploy.** `Dockerfile`/`fly.toml` are written and the bake sequence
   is verified natively. The first real `docker build` ran on the owner's
   laptop on 2026-09-15: eight steps in, the editable install failed on
   `Readme file does not exist: README.md` — the package declares the
   readme and the Dockerfile never copied it. Fixed the same day; the
   build has not yet been seen to finish, so the bake step (the seven
   rebuild commands inside the image, and the `retailer_listings`
   assertion) is still the untested part.
2. **The eval.** 111 labelled comments (215 rows across `aanya`,
   `aanya-verified` and `opus5-draft`), 25 of them a blind calibration
   set labelled 2026-09-15 without sight of the drafts. Human-vs-drafter
   agreement on the 75 shared comments is F1 0.88, and every
   disagreement is the drafter over-reading — OCCASION and BETTER_THAN
   most — so drafts are a fair starting point for *review*, never an
   answer key. Target 200-500 stratified. The 156 drafts from 2026-09-05
   were lost with the container; `eval-batch/` is gitignored, so the
   durable copy of anything labelled is `corpus export` -> commit, the
   same day. A model must never write its own answer key — see the
   blind-check discipline in the README.
3. **First-party feedback** as a fourth provenance voice, silent until
   volume justifies speech, never blended into YouTube counts.
4. **Nordstrom review text.** 2,192 reviews sit on 352 comment-less
   bottles in the raw collection and are *deliberately* not imported:
   shopper prose carries no republication licence. A claims-only
   extraction (typed claims, no stored sentence, no quote on the card) is
   the version that would be defensible, and it is a decision for the
   owner, not a task to pick up.

## Documentation moves with the code

Standing instruction from the owner (2026-08-27): **every commit leaves
README.md, docs/FACET.md and the rest of docs/ describing the current
state of the project.** A behaviour change that would surprise a reader
of those files is not done until the files say otherwise — update them in
the same commit as the change, not in a sweep afterwards. The docs-drift
this rule ended: a README still describing an eight-page dupes site three
product generations after FACET shipped.
