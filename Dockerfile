# FACET, as one image: the kiosk, the API, and a database built from the
# committed corpus at *build* time.
#
#   docker build -t facet .
#   docker run -p 8000:8000 facet
#   open http://localhost:8000/
#
# ## Why the database lives inside the image
#
# This project's README already argues that the database is disposable and
# the corpus is not: `data/corpus/*.jsonl` is the source of truth and a
# rebuild takes seconds. That makes the usual deployment question — which
# managed Postgres, provisioned how, migrated when — mostly beside the
# point for a demo. There is nothing in the database worth keeping that is
# not already in git.
#
# So the rebuild runs during `docker build` and the finished data
# directory is baked into the image. Measured on this corpus the full
# sequence takes ~56s, which is fine once at build time and much too slow
# on every container start, especially behind a host's health check. Boot
# is then just "start postgres, start uvicorn".
#
# The consequence, stated plainly because it is a real one: discovery
# sessions do not survive a restart. They are event-sourced into the same
# disposable database, so a redeploy drops them. For a demo that is the
# right trade; a real deployment would point `FRAGRANCE_DB_URL` at a
# managed instance and run the same seven commands against it (see
# `docker/entrypoint.sh`, which already honours that variable).
#
# ## Why postgres:16 rather than python:slim
#
# The project pins Postgres 16 and its migrations are written against it.
# Starting from the official image and adding Python is one apt install;
# starting from Python and adding a specific Postgres is a third-party
# apt repository and a version to keep in step with CI.
